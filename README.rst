Introduction
===========

The *Links* tab on the *Group* page provides links related to the group. Often,
these will be links concerning the neighborhood that a group represents, or
events and references for a commmunity of practice group. This product supplies
'the change page'_ that allows the contents of the tab to be altered. This
product especially copies the *Change the About Tab* page defined in
``gs.group.about``.

The Change Page
===============

The *Change the Links Tab" page is a simple form that changes the 
``related_links`` property of the group. This module provides the *Change* page
itself and the link from the *Properties* list in the *Admin* tab on the
*Group* page to the *Change* page.
